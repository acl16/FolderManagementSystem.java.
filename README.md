# FOLDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

 # Introduction

The Folder Management System is a simple Java console application that allows users to create and manage a folder structure. The system simulates a file system where users can add subfolders, view the entire folder structure, and interact with it in a hierarchical format. The program uses a tree-like structure to represent folders and their subfolders, offering basic operations to manage them.

WHAT IT CAN DO:

Create a Folder Structure:
The application starts by asking the user to define the root folder.
Users can add subfolders to any existing folder in the structure.

Display Folder Structure:
The program prints the entire folder structure starting from the root. Each folder is displayed with indentation, showing its subfolders recursively.

Simple Folder Management:
The system allows adding new folders under any existing folder. However, the delete and update functionalities could be added for further extension.

WHY I MAKE THIS APPLICATION:

I created the Folder Management System to solve practical problems, such as organizing and managing hierarchical folder structures efficiently. It can be used in real-world applications like file management tools, project organization, or automating tasks in businesses. The system could serve as a foundation for more complex projects, like content management systems, and contribute to others by offering an easy way to handle folders.

This application contributes to me by giving me hands-on experience with important programming concepts like tree structures and recursion. By building it, I get to practice organizing data in a meaningful way, which helps me understand how these concepts work in real-life applications. It also boosts my problem-solving skills.For the community, this application provides a simple tool to manage folder structures, making it easier to organize and visualize hierarchical data. It can inspire beginners to learn about tree structures and recursion, and serve as a starting point for others to build more advanced file management systems or similar projects.
